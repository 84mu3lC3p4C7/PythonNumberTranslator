# SimplePythonNumberCoder
Can code (and decode) given number.
This is my first code, that actually does something, it will do the certain math with every number separated and change it´s order, that can be then decoded back to original number. I don´t know if this is usefull for anything, the main thing was to practice Python, because I am still just a begginer. (Project not finished, still workinh on it!)
