# SimplePythonNumberCoder
Now fully working!
You simply put in a number, it will do certain math with it and change it´s order. Now the number is "coded" and it can be "decoded" back doing exactly the same, just in reverse.
I don´t know if this is usefull for anything, the main thing for me was to train Python.

(Working on update, where user can put a "key" inside and affect the resulted number after math is done.)
